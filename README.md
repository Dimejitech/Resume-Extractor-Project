# Resume-Extractor-Project
This project is an AI-powered resume extractor and summarizer designed to parse unstructured resumes in PDF or DOCX format and convert them into structured, machine-readable data. Built with Streamlit, spaCy, and Hugging Face, the app extracts critical information such as name, email, phone number, LinkedIn/GitHub links, education, work experience, projects, and technical skills.

In addition to structured extraction, it leverages a Hugging Face language model (FLAN-T5) to generate a concise, professional summary of the candidateâ€™s profile. The app also supports exporting parsed data to JSON and CSV for further use in HR systems or analytics pipelines.
